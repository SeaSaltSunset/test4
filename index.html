			<p>My name is Nathaniel Benham. I am currently a student at BYU taking Computer Science as a major, and both English and Design Thinking as minors. This mixture of degrees will be the basis for my entrance into my desired career field: videogame design. Both playing and designing games has been a passion of mine ever since I was young, and I enjoy creating interactive stories that are both engaging, fun, and thought-provoking. <br></p>
